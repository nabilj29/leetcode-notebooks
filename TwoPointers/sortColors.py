#Write a function to sort a given integer array nums in-place (and without the built-in sort function), 
# where the array contains n integers that are either 0, 1, and 2 and represent the colors red, white, and blue. 
# Arrange the objects so that same-colored ones are adjacent, in the order of red, white, and blue (0, 1, 2).
